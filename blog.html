          I grew up in beautiful place called kurseong... The Land of White Orchids. The name behind this quaint little
          town situated close to Darjeeling has an obvious reason. The hill-slopes of Kurseong are home to innumerable
          white orchids that make the landscape look bright and beautiful. A hill station, located around 30 Km from
          Darjeeling, Kurseong is locally known as “Kharsang”. Kharsang, in Lepcha language, means 'Land of White
          Orchids'.
          The weather here is more moderate than Darjeeling and tourism is a major source of livelihood of this hill
          station.
          The greeneries around, soft winds and people around makes this place more peaceful and lovely.

        <h1 class="my-3">History</h1>
        <p class="para">The original inhabitants were the Lepcha people, who named their home "Kurseong", because every
          spring it was alive and bright with Kurson-Rip orchids. In the remote past, Kurseong was a part of the Kingdom
          of Sikkim, even before the British came to India. However, in around 1780 the Kingdom of Nepal conquered and
          annexed Kurseong and its surrounding areas. Then came the Gurkha War, which the Nepalese lost. The 1817 Treaty
          of Titalia restored Kurseong to Sikkim.

          With its mountains providing a cool and dry environment in the summer, Kurseong was a favourite of the
          British. Nevertheless, they found travelling there from the plains of Bengal difficult, even on warm sunny
          days because of the mountains. Although a road was built from Kurseong to Darjeeling from Titalia in the 1770s
          and 1780s, its irregular maintenance soon made the new route, the Military Road, almost useless. The next
          route, Hill Cart Road (now Tenzing Norgay Road), opened in 1861 and fared better.

          Nevertheless, in 1835 the British decided that Darjeeling would make an excellent sanitorium and summer
          residence for their military and civilian officers along with their families. Negotiations with the Chogyal of
          Sikkim, Tshudpud Namgyal, provided them a strip of hill territory in Kurseong for an annual fee. As one of the
          hill stations on the road to Darjeeling, Kurseong began to develop.

          Kurseong is home to one of the oldest municipalities in the state of West Bengal. Established as an
          independent Municipality in 1879, it did not become a Sub-Division until 1890, when the District of Darjeeling
          was formed. Kurseong and the District were added to the Rajshahi Division (now West Central Bangladesh) by the
          British Raj for the Bengal Presidency. In 1908, they were transferred to the Bhagalpur Division in the same
          Presidency.

          Before Independence from the British, there were 12 ward commissioners. Four of them were appointed by the
          British Raj and it also appointed its own man, the Sub-Divisional Officer (S.D.O.), as their chairman. In
          1939, when Bengal became a province of British India, Kurseong was allowed to elect its own member to be the
          chairman, but the Raj continued to send ward commissioners until India gained independence. Nevertheless,
          between 1939 and 1942, Kurseong grew rapidly. As of today Kurseong has 20 commissioners.</p>

        <p class="para">The map alongside shows the eastern portion of the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region and a small portion of the terai region in its eastern and southern fringes, all of it in the Darjeeling district. In the Darjeeling Sadar subdivision 61.00% of the total population lives in the rural areas and 39.00% of the population lives in the urban areas. In the Kurseong subdivision 58.41% of the total population lives in the rural areas and 41.59% lives in the urban areas. There are 78 tea gardens/ estates (the figure varies slightly according to different sources), in the district, producing and largely exporting Darjeeling tea. It engages a large proportion of the population directly/ indirectly. Some tea gardens were identified in the 2011 census as census towns or villages. Such places are marked in the map as CT (census town) or R (rural/ urban centre). Specific tea estate pages are marked TE.

          Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the subdivision. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map.</p>
